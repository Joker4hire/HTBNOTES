# Getting Started with a Pentest Distro

## Choosing a Distro

There are many Linux distributions (distros) for penetration testing. There are quite a few Debian-based pre-existing distros preloaded with many tools that we need to perform our assessments. Many of these tools are rarely required, and no distro contains every tool that we need to perform our assessments. As we learn and progress in our careers, we will gravitate to specific tools and have a list of "must-haves" to add to a new distro. As we progress, we may even prefer to fully customize our own pentesting VM from a Debian or Ubuntu base image, but building a fully custom VM is outside this module's scope.


**It is important to note that each penetration test or security assessment must be performed from a freshly installed VM to avoid including security-relevant details from another client environment in our reports by accident or retaining client-sensitive data for significant lengths of time. For this reason, we must have the ability to quickly stand up a new pentest machine and have processes in place (automation, scripts, detailed procedures, etc.) for quickly setting up our distro(s) of choice for each assessment we perform.**

## Setting up a pentest distro


**There is many ways on how to set up pentesting distros the mainly used ones today are having a vm machine or dual booting**

---

## ISO 

**The Iso File is essentially just a CD-ROM that can be monuted within a virtual machine**

---

## OVA 

**The OVA file is a pre-built virtual appliance that contains an OVF XML file that specifies the VM hardware settings and a VMDK, which is the virtual disk that the operating system is installed on. An OVA is pre-built and therefore can be rapidly deployed to get up and running quicker.**
